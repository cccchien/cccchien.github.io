# Problems

## (1)

Design an overfitting model and plot the accuracy and loss of both training and validation cases

## (2)

Design a CNN model, two fully-connected models with one shallow-designed and the other deep-designed.

# Concept

## (1)

To overfit means that the model learned too well that it even remember the noises.
So, I designed a 7-layered deep network with 512 neurons in each layer, which has approximately 2 million parameters to be trained. I as well increased the epochs to make the model more likely to remember the noises.

## (2)

To compare three different models, we have to ensure that the three models have approximately the same number of parameters to be trained.
